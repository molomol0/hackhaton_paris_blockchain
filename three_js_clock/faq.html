    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>What is this site?</h2>
        <p>This site is a decentralized application (dApp) where users can participate in gamified prize pools on the Bahamut blockchain, based on a "last-bidder-wins" concept. Each prize pool grows as users contribute, and the last participant before the timer runs out wins the entire pool.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>How do the Clocks work?</h2>
        <p>Each time a participant contributes to a clock, the prize pool increases and the countdown is extended. If no one else contributes before the timer runs out, the last contributor wins the prize. Clocks represent different prize pools: the main clock holds the largest reward with the longest timer, while secondary clocks offer smaller prizes and shorter durations. Each clock has its own independent countdown.</p>

        <h2>How can I play?</h2>
        <p>To get started, connect your MetaMask wallet to the app. Once connected and with sufficient funds, you can buy tickets. Each ticket allows you to participate in a clock — one ticket equals one entry.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>Are the transactions safe?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Every action — whether it's buying a ticket, creating a clock, or distributing rewards (even off-chain) — is securely recorded on the blockchain. Our smart contract has been audited for security, and parts of our dApp’s code are open-source for full transparency.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>How can I create my own clock?</h2>
        <p>You can submit a request to create your own clock from the Partners page. Simply fill out the form with the required information, and our team will review your request and get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>Can the main clock last forever?</h2>
        <p>No, the application has a final deadline. Once this time is reached, if the main clock hasn't closed yet, all the last participants of all active clocks — including the main one — will win the corresponding prizes.</p>
